For random inserts of 10,000 strings of 100 length each, our naive BSTMap map took 0.01 seconds compared to Java's TreeMap and HashMap's 0.01 seconds.
61B's Linked List Map took 0.48 seconds.

For random inserts of 100,000 strings of 100 length each, there was a Stack Overflow error and runtime stopped prematurely.
However, our naive BSTMap took 0.12 seconds, whereas Java's built-in maps took 0.11 seconds, at whatever string count Intellij stopped at.

For ordered inserts of 10,000 strings (no specified string length because lexicographical ascending order is determined), our naive BSTMap took 0.46 seconds compared to
Java's TreeMap and HashMap's 0.01 and 0.00 seconds, respectively.

For random inserts of 100,000 strings, there was a Stack Overflow error and runtime stopped prematurely. There were no results for our
naive BSTMap, but Java's TreeMap and HashMap got 0.04 seconds and 0.02 seconds, respectively.
