For random inserts of 10,000 strings of 100 length each, our naive Hashmap buckets took 0.03 seconds with ArrayList, 0.02 seconds with
LinkedList, 0.02 seconds with HashSet, 0.01 seconds with Stack, and 0.01 seconds with ArrayDeque.

For random inserts of 10,000 strings of 100 length each, our naive Hashmap buckets took 0.17 seconds with ArrayList, 0.14 seconds
with LinkedList, 0.15 seconds with HashSet, 0.14 seconds with Stack, and 0.14 seconds with ArrayDeque.

Comparatively, for InsertInOrderSpeedTest using 10,000 strings to insert in order, ULLMap took 0.51 seconds, our naive
Hashmap took 0.03 seconds, and Java's built-in Hashmap took 0.01 seconds. For random insertions of the same amount of strings,
ULLMap took 0.48 seconds, our naive Hashmap took 0.03 seconds, and Java's built-in Hashmap took 0.03 seconds.
